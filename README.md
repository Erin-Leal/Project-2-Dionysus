# RSVPlanner

Have you ever tried to plan an event with say, lots of friends, co-workers, or family? Maybe it was a bit hard to keep everyone on the same page on the details. Last minute changes can often be particularly awful, it's hard to make sure everyone will not only get the message, but know where to expect that message. RSVPlanner is an application that mixes social media communication with event searching and planning functionality. It's perfect for people who want to plan social events with their peers in one easy to use place.

## Motivations

One of the harder parts of planning an event is communicating with the people you want in attendance. Making sure everyone is on the same page with the event information through email lists or messages that are easily lost and buried in continuing conversations. This condenses it into one social place that won't excessively bury the information. Information is laid out simply in an easy to understand interface. Personal planners like google calendars can be a little clunky to start with, and lack any group planning functions.

## Current status

Currently both the smaller messages and event posts, as well as user basics are done, same with the public event search on the front page. The main missing feature is the structured friend lists and invite system, which the posts a user sees on their page would be filtered by. This was a bit ambitious for us unfortunately given the timeframe we had to work with, but we liked the idea enough to go for it anyways.

## Team efforts

Bryan was responsible for much of the backend work, primarily the models and added functionality related to them, and his efforts were fundamental to what we were able to present today.

Lillian was responsible for our public event search addition in both initial idea and execution, and was an excellent help with a lot of our creative decisions.

And Scott was thorough in his observations and caught several smaller oversights that might have otherwise gone unnoticed, he designed the icon and also made quality contributions to our concepts, and what we have presented today, and would like to do in the future would look quite different without him.

## My contributions

My primary responsibility was on the front end, making sure the web pages had what we needed and looked polished and nice. There's a lot more I would have liked to do, but it was dependent on changes that came later than we hoped they would, and as for the project end, I tried to make sure communication and delegation of work went as well as it could, however I was overly cautious in the early stages and I think if I had tried to take that role despite my anxieties sooner we could have done much more.

## Future plans

The biggest feature we need is a friend and invite system for our events and a way to link the smaller blurb posts, which will serve as updates and last minute info if it was forgotten in the initial post, bringing it to attention without users having to go back and view an older post. Past that it's slight to moderate changes to the front end to reflect those additions and add more polish and flavor.
